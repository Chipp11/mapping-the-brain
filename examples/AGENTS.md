# AGENTS.md — Agent Workspace Instructions

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. If in main session: Also read `MEMORY.md`

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories, like a human's long-term memory

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember.

### Write It Down — No "Mental Notes"!

- Memory is limited — if you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE
- "Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Files do.
- When someone says "remember this" → update memory files
- When you learn a lesson → document it
- When you make a mistake → write it down so future-you doesn't repeat it
- **Text > Brain** 📝
